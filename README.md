# Building the Frontend
### **The prereqs for this build are Node and React**
#### e.g the ability to use npm

#### The two extra modules that we are using for the frontend are
* ```$ npm i react-router-dom react-big-calendar ```
#### `react-router-dom`: This allows us to use the file type .jsx to create routes within the app for different pages such as login, signup and home
#### `react-big-calendar`: This allows for the monthly calendar view of tasks to be completed

### **To run the app locally git clone this repo and run the command**
* ```$ npm start```

### In order for the app to fully work the backend must also be running
### Make sure that MongoDB is started then use ```flask run``` to run the backend
* The frontend interacts with the backend and database for all user data
