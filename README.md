# csc307-doit
## This branch holds the all the Frontend Data for our app, Do It!

### Make sure that you have all the node modules installed including the one listed below

#### The one extra module that we are using for routing the program is
* ```$ npm i react-router-dom ```
#### This allows us to use the file type .jsx to create routes within the app for different pages such as login, signup and home
#

### To run the app on local host clone the repo and run
* ```$ npm start```

### In order for the app to fully work the backend must also be running
### Make sure that MongoDB is started then use ```flask run``` to run the backend
#### The frontend interacts with the backend and database for all user data
